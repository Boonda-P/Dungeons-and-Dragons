\subsection{Detailed Description}
Implementation file for the \hyperlink{classHumanPlayerStrategy}{Human\+Player\+Strategy} class. 

Implement character (friendly or unfriendly) actions as strategy pattern Each turn, a character can proceed with\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item move
\item attack
\item free action
\end{DoxyItemize}

Must implement these Concrete\+Strategies\+: 1) a \hyperlink{classHumanPlayerStrategy}{Human\+Player\+Strategy} that lets the user decide where to move, who to attack, and what free actions to take; 2) an \hyperlink{classAggressorStrategy}{Aggressor\+Strategy} that make the character automatically move towards and attack the player character; 3) a \hyperlink{classFriendlyStrategy}{Friendly\+Strategy} that makes the character automatically move towards the character, but not attack unless attacked, in which case it adopts the Aggressor\+Strategy.\+klA
